Debugging Behavioral Programs Using Models@run.time

Behavioral Programming is a software development approach, which allows to incrementally develop applications in terms of scenarios described by sets of behavior threads, which interact in a special way with one another.
This reduces the gap between problem and solution space, as scenarios as main building block in behavioral programming actually crosscut problem and solution space.

Models@run.time on the other hand is a software development approach promoting the use of models and modelling techniques at system runtime. Each system based on models@runt.ime has a key architectural constituent: a causal connection between a runtime model and the running system. Changes in the runtime model are propagated to the running system and vice versa. The main purpose of using a runtime model is to have an adequate abstraction of a running system for a given task, which could, e.g., be reasoning for self-adaptation.
